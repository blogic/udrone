What is udrone
--------------

Udrone i a system that allows you to remotely control N drones. The N drones can be sent a number of different commands. based on these commands the drone will performa a number of actions and report the resulty back to the drone host controller. The system consists of a nuber of files on the controller side

* udrone.py - the core component. this code establishes a communication channel to the drone.
* qa.py - this is a wrapper fro udrone.py that allows us to wirte test in json syntax and run them in a sane manner
* *.json - this is a collection of predefined tests, that the drone can run

Starting the host is trivially easy, simply call

----
$ ./qa.py mytest.json
----

Once all test are run, the qa toll will report back if the test passed or failed.


Definition of test cases
------------------------

So, lets start by looking at the format of the json file. The basic layout of any json based test description is as follows
----
{
	"id":"The ID of the test",
	"desc":"The description of the test",
	"drones":the_number_of_drones,
	"test":[ the actual test caes go here ],
}
----

Within the test:[] entity we will start to define all the different test cases that want to run as part of this test. A typical testcase would look like this
----
{
	"desc":"use fatserver calls to set public_essid)",
	"repeat":how_often_we_want_to_run_the_test,
	"first":loop_from_first,
	"last":loop_to_last,
	"sleep":how_many_seconds_to_sleep_after_the_test,
	"cmd":[ the actual commands to be called go here ],
}
----
If last/first is set, repeat will be ignored.


Within the cmd:[] entity we define the actual real commands that we want the drone to execute as part of the test. Consider these to be a reduced to the smallest denominator of commands called (or in other terms, these are risc commands and not cisc). The command can have a varity of functions, from setting local and remote network settings, doing a generic sleep, talking to the DUT, doing random networkery,....

Lets start by looking at a single row

----
[ "ACTION", .................. ]
----

every line start with a ACTION. Depending on the real ACTION to take, we can have N parameters following the ACTON call.

Actions can be of 3 types. So lets look at 3 lines

----
{
	[ "sleep", 5 ],
	[ "drone", 1, "webui_auth", {"pass":"foobar"}, 300 ],
	[ "essid", 1, "foorandom", "12345321234" ],
}
----


* sleep - sleep

----
	[ "sleep", 5 ]

	// this makes the system wait 5 seconds
----

* drone - send commands to drone

----
	[ "drone", 1, "webui_auth", {"pass":"foobar"}, 300 ],

	//we want to send a command to a drone, whose id is 1, the commands id is "webui_auth" and we
	//pass the payload {"pass":"foobar"}. if the call fails to return within 300s, we raise a failure/exception
----

* $complex - when ACTIONS become to complex to be handled by the "drone" call, we can add additional handlers inside qa.py to abstract the complexion away abit.

----
	[ "essid", 1, "foorandom", "12345321234" ]

	// run the complex command essid. this sets the essid of drone 1 to foorandom and uses 12345321234 as a passphrase
	// this call is complex as we dont only send a command, but 2 and then poll for their completion.
	// completion is detected by polling the network status reporting info from the DUT
----

All complex functions are located inside qa.py



A full test would look like this

----
{
	"id":"test123",
	"desc":"A demo testcase.",
	"drones":1,
	"test":
	[
		{
			"desc":"log into webui and set essid",
			"repeat":1,
			"sleep":1,
			"cmd":
			[
				{
					[ "sleep", 5 ],
					[ "drone", 1, "webui_auth", {"pass":"foobar"}, 300 ],
					[ "essid", 1, "foorandom", "12345321234" ],
				}
			],
		},
	],
}
----


Using iterations and substitution
---------------------------------
As described above a test set can be repeated N times (repeat: 4). To reflect the N itwrations within the test we can use variable substitution. To do so, simply place "$iterate" inside any paramter section and it will get magically replaced by the backend. A simple iteration example would look like this.

----
{
	"id":"example.iterate",
	"desc":"Demo of how iterate works",
	"drones":1,
	"test":[
		{"desc":"repeat example",
		"repeat":4,
		"sleep":2,
		"cmd":[ [ "comment", "Iteration $iterate" ] ]
		}
	]
}


-->
RUN "iterate" - iteration 1
COMMENT Iteration 1
RUN "iterate" - iteration 2
COMMENT Iteration 2
RUN "iterate" - iteration 3
COMMENT Iteration 3
RUN "iterate" - iteration 4
COMMENT Iteration 4



{
	"id":"example.iterate",
	"desc":"Demo of how iterate works",
	"drones":1,
	"test":[
		{"desc":"first->last example",
		"first":4,
		"last":"6,
		"sleep":2,
		"cmd":[ [ "comment", "Iteration $iterate" ] ]
		}
	]
}


-->
RUN "iterate" - iteration 4
COMMENT Iteration 4
RUN "iterate" - iteration 5
COMMENT Iteration 5
RUN "iterate" - iteration 6
COMMENT Iteration 6
----

In addition we can use variable substition. To do so simply create a new value inside conf.py and then reference it inside your json code

----
[ "drone", 1, "cloudlogin", {"user":"$cloud_user", "pass":"$cloud_pass", "host":"$cloud_url"}, 300 ]
----


List of all complex calls
-------------------------

Generally we use complex calls whenever we need to not just send data but wait for a status.

----
# set a static IP on drone 1
[ "static", 1, "192.168.10.2", "255.255.255.0" ]

# set essid of drone 1 to wifitest and wpa key to
[ "essid", 1, "wifitest", "blafablafa" ]

# trigger drone 1
[ "dhcp", 1 ]

# sleep 5 seconds
[ "sleep", 1 ]

# fail is a test result inverter. it switces a result true<->false
[ "fail", "dhcp", 1 ]

# this will trigger qa.py to print a comment in the log
[ "comment", "foooooobar" ]

# this will cause drone 1 to try and ping a remote url
[ "ping", 1, "192.168.10.1" ]

# this will check if the IP received in a dhcp reply received by drone 1 matches certain criterions.
[ "checkip", 1, "192.168.10." ]
----

As netmasks are limited to 32 and or not always obvious which once are valid, we have 2 special complex calls to handle this. Netmasks are always indexed by an id rather than a absolute mask.

----
# this will set the netmask on drone 1 to Mask index #1
[ "setnetmask", 1 ]
# this will check if the netmask received in a dhcp reply received by drone 1 matches certain criterions of Mask index #1
[ "checknetmask", 1 ]
----

Finally we have a complex call that we use as our entry point for RPC on a Drone

----
# send a drone RPC call to drone 1.
[ "drone", 1, "webui_auth", {"pass":"admin"}, 300 ],
----

List of all drone calls
-----------------------

----
# dns_flood - do mass dns resolving
[ "drone", 1, "dns_flood", ["www.google.de", "www.google.com"]

# download - download a file and check its size
[ "drone", 1, "download", {"url":"http://dev.phrozen.org/test", "repeat":"4", "size":"1048576"}, 300 ]

# fatserver - simulate a fatserver call - this requires a DUT with dev mode enaböed
[ "drone", 1, "fatserver", {"host":"192.168.10.1", "payload":"json|{\"cmd\":\"setwpapassword\", \"val\":\"12345321234\" }" } ]

# cloudlogin - log into a cloudspot using http redirects
[ "drone", 1, "cloudlogin", {"user":"$cloud_user", "pass":"$cloud_pass", "host":"$cloud_url"}, 300 ]

# cloudwispr - log into a cloudspot using wispr

# cloudlogout - log of the cloud service
[ "drone", 1, "cloudlogout" ]

# webui_auth - tell the drone to log into the DUTs webui
[ "drone", 1, "webui_auth", {"pass":"admin"}, 300 ]

# webui_rpc - send a webui rpc call (these are identical to the ones used by the normal webui)
[ "drone", 1, "webui_rpc", { "set":"passwd", "vals":{"passwd1":"fooooooooo" } } ],

# webui_deauth - log off the webui
[ "drone", 1, "webui_deauth" ]

# webui_ip - use a different webui ip than 192.168.10.1
[ "drone", 1, "webui_ip", {"ipaddr":"169.254.255.1"}, 300 ],

# uci_dump - get
[ "drone", 1, "uci_dump", {"package":"cloud", "section":"state", "state":1 }, 300 ],
----


The following calls exist but are currently unused

* upgrade - FW upgrade of the Drone
* system - execute a random system call on the drone
* uci_dump - get some use values
* uci_replace - uci magic
* getifaddrs - get a list of all netdevs inclusive the ipaddr ...
* reset - reboot the drone
* readfile - read a random file from the drones FS
* sysinfo - get system resource usage
